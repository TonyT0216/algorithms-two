## This is my Java repository for the completion and refinement of algorithms, searches, sorts, etc.

[This is my personal website](http://thecafeprogrammer.com)

_So why I am doing this?_

I want to showcase my skills in calculation of algorithms, as well as my skills in Java.  It's my strongest language.  I absolutely welcome feedback from other users. 

# [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/TonyT0216/algorithms-two/tree/master/src/fizzbuzz)
_added on 3/3/2017_

This seemed to me to be a straightforward problem.  Based off of LeetCode's version, the request that was given is to output a List of Strings that represent the numbers from 1 to n, given an int n (inclusive).  For every multiple of three, the number is replaced with the word "Fizz". For every multiple of five, the number is replaced with the word "Buzz".  And for a number that is multiple of both, the number is replaced with FizzBuzz.
